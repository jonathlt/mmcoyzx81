																<h4 align="center">SPIRALS</h4>
																<p>In this fast moving real-time graphics game (intended for use with SLOW) you are placed at the start of a square spiral and must reach the end of it in the minimum possible time. Your score is constantly displayed - it starts of at 99900 and decrements continuously, but you can't cheat by breaking out early with a high score - the program won't allow that. Now and again the score will reach zero before you reach the end of the spiral. If that happens you obviously need more practice!</p>
																<p>This fascinating and highly amusing game is unfortunately for NEW ROM users with <u>SLOW</u> only. It will not work in FAST because although the program will still consider itself to be running perfectly smoothly, the average human operator won't know what's going on because of the fact that the screen in front of them is completely black.</p>
																<p>This is a fascinating game to watch - witnessing the score decrease before your very eyes is surprisingly effective. You can make the game as difficult as you like by altering the initial value of the "timing" - held in BC. I've given it 0400, but you could use 0800 for a slower game, 0200 for a faster game, and so on.</p>
																<p>There is one difficulty built in though - if you hit a wall you don't just bounce off, you actually become embedded in it, and the only way you can get out is to exactly <u>reverse</u> your direction. It can be quite tricky.</p>
																<p>Well good luck on your race - keep a record of the high scores (no cheating) and see if you can master it.</p>
																<p>The keys will move you as follows: Any key on the bottom row will move you downwards (except for shift, which has no effect), any key on the top row moves you up. The middle two rows move you left and right, with the lefthand ten keys (QWERTASDFG) moving you to the left, and the ten righthand keys (YUIOPHJKLn/l) moving you to the right. This system was adopted instead of using the cursor controls 5, 6, 7, and 8 for two reasons.</p>
																<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;list-style-image: none;">
																	<li>It is easier for people to understand and become familiar with.</li>
																	<li>It is easier to program, since we only need to test one register after the keyboard scan instead of two.</li>
																</ul>
																<p>The program lists as follows, and can be relocated to any desired location by changing just <del>one</del> [two] addresses. The program should be called from the point labelled START.</p>

As I used HEXLD3D to load this high, the instructions are as follows: Set RAMTOP to 4A00 (18944) with POKE 16389,74/NEW. Type RUN to play the game. Addresses used: 4A82 to 4B77 is occupied by HEXLD3D, SPRINT is 4B82, START is 4B8C (19340), LOOP is 4C2D and the timing value SPEED (default 0400) is held at 4C4C which you'll probably want to double to 0800.]</p>

																<p>In this version of BREAKOUT, which incidentally may only be run on a NEW ROM in SLOW, you move the bat with any of the keys on the keyboard - those on the left will move you to the left, and those on the right will move you to the right. The game is intended to be played only by those people with 3.25K or more, but it can be persuaded to run in less if the following few lines of machine code are added to the program - these should precede the main program:</p>

																</table>
																<p>The reason for this is that the main BREAKOUT program assumes that the screen is initially completely full - that is, that it contains twenty-four rows, each consisting of thirty-two spaces followed by a newline. If your machine has less than 3.25K on board then this will not be so, because of the way that the ROM sets up the screen. To rectify this we first LD (IY+22) with 00. IY is always 4000 at the start of any USR routine, so IY+22 is 4022, which is the system variable DF_SZ. This represents the number of rows in the bottom half of the screen (the part we cannot print to) - by telling the machine that this number is zero it follows that the number of rows that we cannot print to is also zero, thus the whole screen is at our disposal. HL counts the number of spaces to be printed to ensure that we do not try to run off the end of the screen.</p>
																<p>BREAKOUT is a program in four parts. These parts are:</p>
																<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;list-style-image: none;">
																	<li>Initialise everything.</li>
																	<li>Restart the game for each new ball.</li>
																	<li>Move the ball.</li>
																	<li>Move the bat.</li>
																</ul>
																<p>We will go over each of these steps in scrutinous detail.</p>
																<p>Firstly to initialise everything. This involves a) printing the playing board, b) defining the initial ball position, and c) setting the initial speed of the game. To print the board:</p>

																<p>You'll notice that in this version of the game I've ensured that a row of full stops is printed below the very bottom of the screen. This provides a convenient test for whether or not the ball has hit the base. Finally, to set the ball position and speed, the procedure is:</p>

																</table>
																<p>This is actually all the initialisation we need. You'll notice several things missing - for example although the ball is located it is not actually printed. The bat is not mentioned at all! The reason is that the bat is redrawn every time the game is restarted, and so is the ball. Why bother to find the initial position then? Well in this version, the ball starts off in a slightly different position each time. This ensures that it is possible to wipe out all of the bricks.</p>
																<p>The variable SPEED has a dual purpose. Firstly it determines the speed of the game - that is, the speed at which the bat and ball will move (the bat moves at precisely twice the ball speed), but secondly it determines when the game is over. When SPEED decrements to zero (the lower the number, the faster the game) we know that the game is over.</p>
																<p>Section two of the game does the following tasks:</p>
																<ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;list-style-image: none;">
																	<li>Change the initial ball position, whilst also noting the <u>current</u> ball position and printing the ball.</li>
																	<li>Set the initial direction of movement of the ball to up/right.</li>
																	<li>Change the speed of the game and check for end of game.</li>
																	<li>Print the bat, and at the same time delete any previous bat symbol that may have been there.</li>
																	<li>Give the human player a chance to recover from the last session, since presumably [he/]she won't want one ball to leap into the game immediately [after] the last one vanishes.</li>
																</ul>
																<p>The section is this. Look at the manner in which the bat is printed and the previous bat overwritten.</p>

																<p>The last two lines, which cause a short pause between sessions, will become clear when the start of the next section is given.</p>
																<p>To move the ball we first of all go through a timed delay loop (controlled by SPEED - the speed of the game) and then <u>unprint</u> the previous position of the ball. The contents of the next square in the direction the ball is travelling are examined, and one of the following will happen:</p>
																<ul>
																	<li>If a full stop has been reached then the ball has gone off the bottom of the screen - the game is restarted.</li>
																	<li>If either a space (i.e. nothing hit) or a brick is located, the ball is reprinted, at this new position.</li>
																	<li>If anything other than a space is reached, the direction of movement of the ball is changed at random.</li>
																	<li>If the ball was <u>not</u>reprinted then find the contents of the next square in this new direction and re-examine the situation.</li>
																	<li>If a brick was hit, the score is increased by 1.</li>
																</ul>																
																<p>Now, in order that we may choose a new random direction <u>validly</u> we require a table of directions to choose from. These valid directions are 0020, 0022, FFE0, and FFDE. You should store these numbers, low part first, at any address in RAM, and call the start of this table TABLESTART. The program which will then achieve all of this is as follows:</p>

																<p>An interesting point to watch for is the way in which the score is increased. Compare the mechanism to that used in SPIRALS to decrease the score. There are one or two differences between this and the last. Firstly of course we are here using INVERSE digits instead of ordinary digits, though this difference is rather trivial. Secondly the BREAKOUT score <u>increases</u> instead of decreases. Thirdly, the SPIRALS score would terminate at zero, whereas the BREAKOUT score can increase indefinitely.</p>
																<p>To move the bat, first of all the keyboard is scanned, and if a left-hand key is pressed [then] the bat is moved to the left, provided of course there is not a wall in the way, and if a right-hand key is pressed then the bat is moved to the right, if possible. Note that if a left <u>and</u> right key are pressed simultaneously [then] the bat should not move at all. In our program such a circumstance would cause the bat to move first to the left, and then to the right.</p>
																<p>Study this, the final part of the program, and watch the way the bat is actually moved. Remember that the variable BATPOS stores the position of the <u>middle</u> of the bat.</p>
