																<h1 align="center">Draughts Part Three</h1>
																<h4 align="center">DRAUGHTS</h4>
																<p>The story so far... Once upon a time a human being input a move to a ZX computer. The computer checked this move to make sure that no cheating was going on, and cast a wicked spell on the poor human if it was, which meant that the whole move had to be typed in all over again. The move was made. The computer started to search through the board for pieces that it could move. Having found a piece, but not knowing whether or not it could move, it then miraculously found itself at an address called EVALUATE. Where do we go from here?</p>
																<p>Let's start off by saying that a neutral move - that is a move which achieves nothing, but also loses nothing - has a "priority" of <u>80</u> (hex).</p>
																<p>The first point worth noting is that if a piece is in imminent danger of being captured then it stands to reason that we ought to move it out of the way - unless something more important crops up. Secondly, if a piece if preventing another piece from being captured, then we should be less likely to move it. Both of these conditions apply regardless of which direction we consider moving the piece. It stands to reason then that we should work out this part of the priority first, before we start analysing each of the different directions. We must therefore work out a numerical value that corresponds to the <u>square</u> that we are looking at. This value will then be added to 80, after which each direction in turn will be analysed.</p>
																<p>EVALUATE will therefore start off</p>

																<p>The last instruction stores the value we've found for use later on in the game. On the OLD ROM the address of INITIAL should be changed to 4019. Now let's take a closer look at the subroutine SQUAREVAL. It will assign a value as follows - starting with zero, if a piece is in danger it will add five, or seven for a king. If it is protecting a piece it will subtract five, or seven for a king. Further, the subroutine, as with all subroutines from now on, must not be allowed to alter the values of any register except A. One way of doing this is to begin the subroutine</p>

																<p>Now for the rest of that decision making routine EVALUATE. It contains a deliberate mistake - see if you can find it (the program will still run perfectly smoothly even with the mistake still in)! If you can't sus it out on your own I'll tell you later on.</p>
																<p>This routine is designed to compute a numerical value - a "priority" - for any individual move. Having done so it will compare this priority with those moves stored on the stack. If the new priority is less, it will forget this move and go on to explore a new one. If the new move is <u>equal</u> in priority it will be stored on the stack. If the new priority is <u>more</u> than those on the stack then the list will be abolished, and a new list started.</p>
																<p>The registers in the routine have the following jobs:</p>
																<ul>
																	<li>A - a general purpose working register.</li>
																	<li>B - counts the number of items in the list. You may remember the CHOOSE routine earlier on relied on B containing this number of items.</li>
																	<li>C - a general purpose working register.</li>
																	<li>DE - a pointer which looks at the table of allowable directions of movement.</li>

																<p>This is necessary because a move into danger is bad, and moving to protect another piece is good. Notice that by design the subroutine SQUAREVAL will not change the value of any register except A. One unfortunate flaw in the subroutine means that moving a king into danger will only generate the value five, rather than seven. Can you see why? Follow the subroutine through if you can't. Finally you should note that SQUAREVAL only requires L to be assigned initially, not HL. This is deliberate.</p>

																<p>As it stands the program will not test whether or not a computer's piece has reached the back row (and thus become a king). This is not a programming error, this is quite deliberate. The reason is that this is something I'd like you to do for yourself. Study the way in which the check on a human's piece is made - the low part of the destination address is compared with the low part of the address of the boundary between the back row and the second row - and make a similar test. You should find this a very simple addition to the program.</p>
																<p>The EVALUATE routine is now complete. The whole program is now a closed structure - there are no holes in it now, no RET statements temporarily taking the place of subroutines that aren't there. If you now RUN the program (by typing RUN 4) it will actually make moves! Of course it won't do much else, but you should now be able to see how far we've progressed.</p>
																<p>Oh - there is of course that deliberate mistake to think about. If you didn't notice it in the listing you probably noticed it by playing it. The problem is that the computer <u>won't jump</u>. As you can imagine this leads to a very poor game on its part.</p>
																<p>The mistake is in the line labelled TEST. It currently says JR NZ,NXTMRND, which means that if a square in any particular direction is simply not empty then it will try a different direction. The line <u>should</u> read JR NZ,WHAT, where WHAT is a routine (which we haven't yet written) which is designed to decide whether the destination square contains a human's piece, whether a jump is possible - even whether or not a multiple jump is possible - and to evaluate the priority of whatever it finds.</p>
																<p>[Thunor: To fix the deliberate mistake, change the byte at address 4E6Bh to 33h.]</p>
																<p>Here is one such subroutine. It is not the only possible one, but a suggestion of one means of doing it. This particular version will cope only with single jumps, not with multiple jumps: The routine begins at <del>4E9B</del> [4E9F]:</p>

That's it for the author supplied code. The author states that to finish it requires that you write the remaining parts yourself! At the moment I don't intend to go any further with the program as I was expecting it to be a complete version. The version here that I am offering for download includes all of the author offered code and the modification to the deliberate mistake. Set RAMTOP to 4A00 (18944) with POKE 16389,74/NEW. Type RUN 4 to play the game. Unfortunately the game crashes when the computer makes a jump. When transcribing, I have a process of checking the code when writing it and then checking again when I've written a sizeable chunk. I've also gone through and checked the hex-code of the program against the listing in <a href="../..//home/jonathan/Documents/src/mmcoyzx81/mmcoyzx81-0.1.9/appendix06.html">appendix six</a>, and so I believe there is a logic error somewhere that I currently don't have the time to track down.]</p>
                                <p>[Thunor: For the NEW ROM only, there's a detailed program listing with instructions in <a href="../..//home/jonathan/Documents/src/mmcoyzx81/mmcoyzx81-0.1.9/appendix06.html">appendix six</a>.]</p>
																<p>As you can see, the principle for finding a single jump is relatively straightforward. With this routine in place the computer will now play an adequate game of draughts, but although the human player is allowed to make multiple jumps, the computer will not. <u>This addition I leave you to write yourself</u>. I will, however give you a couple of hints.</p>
																<p>First of all, the registers all have specific uses. All that is, except for A and C. These are as follows:</p>
																<ul>
																	<li>B - The number of choices of move available.</li>
																	<li>D - The priority of the current move.</li>
																	<li>E - The number of steps in the current move.</li>
																	<li>H - The direction being moved this step.</li>
																	<li>L - The low part of the address of the current square (within WKBOARD).</li>
																</ul>
																<p>I suggest giving C a use too - it should be used to store <u>which step</u> of a multiple-step move we are currently examining. In other words, on the second step C will be two, on the third step C will be three, and so on. It is fairly easy to preserve the values of all of the registers by making proper use of the stack.</p>
																<p>Nesting the subroutines and loops properly, so that the same routine is used to check for a third move as is used to check for a second move, is not as difficult as you might think - it merely requires a bit of positive thinking. It also has the advantage that, in theory, the computer can actually make twelve-fold jumps with no extra programming. The looping is not the biggest problem.</p>
																<p>There are two problems which will face you. These are:</p>
																<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;list-style-image: none;">
																	<li>Having stored C-1 steps of the current move on the stack, how do we store step C (i.e. how do we insert it into the middle of the stack)?</li>
																	<li>Having established that the current move now stands at C steps, and can be increased no more, one of the following must happen: If C is less than E then the current move is abolished; if C is equal to E, the stack is left unchanged; if C is greater than E then the whole list of moves on the stack <u>except</u> the current move is abolished.</li>
																</ul>
																<p>Let's take a look at the first problem first. Assuming C-1 steps are stacked, the situation we now have is this:</p>

																<p>You'll notice that the sequence LD HL,0000/ADD HL,SP is necessary because there is no such instruction as LD HL,SP (even though LD SP,HL is allowed). LDIR is used to shift the required part of the stack down one byte. The exact number of bytes to be shifted must first be very carefully calculated, and stored in BC in order that LDIR will work properly. Coincidentally LDIR will leave DE finally pointing to just the right address for us to store the current direction. Since HL is at the top of the stack we may remove it, and load the current direction (H) into position, via A, <u>before</u> we remove DE and BC. Thus the stack pointer is still where we want it, and none of the values of any register (except A) have been changed.</p>

																<p>Finally, C is incremented because we are now ready to examine the next step.</p>
																<p>The two procedures involved in the second problem may be solved by careful study of the above process. To abolish the current move is simple - DE is popped, the stack pointer is then incremented by the exact number of bytes, and DE is pushed back again. The second procedure, that of abolishing the whole list except for the current move may be achieved by loading HL with the position within the stack of "direction C", DE with the contents of the variable LBASE, and then using LDDR, however, you'll have to do some thinking in order to work out BC (the number of bytes to be moved) and the new position of the stack pointer. If you understand how ADDASTEP works it will not be all that difficult to do.</p>
																<p>With this problem to solve, I will leave you. It's not impossible I assure you. Finally, consider the length of this program so far - our addresses still begin with 4E, and we are allowed to go as far as 4FFF (although we need some left over for the screen and the stack). 1K draughts is quite, quite possible. With thought you may even be able to shorten it further.</p>
